File Extraordinary Manager is a python package using SQLite to manage your files in your computer. 
That will help you if you always ask yourself,

     2. How to sort my files in a smart way?
     3. How to dig all the potential of my computer?
This software can help you open your file in terminal and with just a simple TUI(in the future).
